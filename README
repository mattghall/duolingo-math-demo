# Duolingo Math Assistant Demo

This project is a prototype math assistant inspired by the Advanced Math Team at Duolingo. It leverages AI to generate engaging, context-rich math problems from user-provided premises and selected categories.

## Project Overview

- **Goal:** Turn any premise (e.g., "Taylor Swift") and a math category (Algebra, Geometry, Logarithms, Sequences) into a creative, high-quality math problem.
- **Example:**
  - **Premise:** Taylor Swift
  - **Category:** Geometry
  - **Generated Problem:** "Taylor Swift is performing in a circular arena. If the arena has a radius of 50 meters, what is the maximum number of fans that can attend if each fan needs 1 square meter of space?"

## Features
- User inputs a premise (any topic, name, or idea)
- User selects a math category from a dropdown (Algebra, Geometry, Logarithms, Sequences)
- AI generates a relevant math problem based on the input
- Designed for rapid prototyping and extensibility
