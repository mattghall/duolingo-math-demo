# Duolingo Math Assistant Demo

This project is a prototype math assistant inspired by the Advanced Math Team at Duolingo. It leverages AI to generate engaging, context-rich math problems from user-provided premises and selected categories.

## Project Overview

- **Goal:** Turn any premise (e.g., "Taylor Swift") and a math category (Algebra, Geometry, Logarithms, Sequences) into a creative, high-quality math problem.
- **Example:**
  - **Premise:** Taylor Swift
  - **Category:** Geometry
  - **Generated Problem:** "Taylor Swift is performing in a circular arena. If the arena has a radius of 50 meters, what is the maximum number of fans that can attend if each fan needs 1 square meter of space?"

## Features
- User inputs a premise (any topic, name, or idea)
- User selects a math category from a dropdown (Algebra, Geometry, Logarithms, Sequences)
- AI generates a relevant math problem based on the input
- Designed for rapid prototyping and extensibility

## Tech Stack
- Python (backend logic)
- Streamlit (for the web UI)
- OpenRouter (for LLM API access)
- KaTeX (for math rendering in Streamlit)

## Running Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mattghall/duolingo-math-demo.git
   cd duolingo-math-demo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root with your API keys:
     ```
     OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-openrouter-api-key
     ```
   - Or, export the variable in your shell:
     ```sh
     export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-openrouter-api-key
     ```

4. **Run the app:**
   ```sh
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. **Access the app:**
   - Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

## Notes
- All equations and math expressions are formatted in LaTeX for best rendering in Streamlit.
- The app is designed for demo and prototyping purposes.
